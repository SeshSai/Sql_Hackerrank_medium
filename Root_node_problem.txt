Given:

N is the node of the tree
P is the parent of the node N

What's asked?

We need to find the node type of the binary tree (Root i.e the start of the tree)/(inner i.e the next split/splits after root)/(leaf/leafs i.e. the end where there is no further splits)
In short we need to find
root or inner or leaf

Conditions:

condition1: Result shoud be ordered by the value of the node descending


select N,
case
    when N NOT IN (select distinct(P) from BST where P is not null) then 'Leaf'
    when N IN (select N from BST where P is null) then 'Root'
    else 'Inner' end as types
from BST
order by N
